# Prodigy Infotech – Task 02: Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset

This repository contains my submission for **Task 02** of the **Data Science Internship** at **Prodigy Infotech**. In this task, I performed data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset to uncover patterns and understand the features affecting passenger survival.

## 📌 Task Overview

**Objective:**  
Analyze the Titanic dataset using EDA techniques, clean the data, handle missing values, and visualize relationships between features like age, class, and survival.

> 💡 This task helped me improve my skills in data cleaning, visualization, and exploratory analysis. It also deepened my understanding of how different features contribute to outcomes in a dataset.  
> I'm participating in this internship to gain practical experience, expand my project portfolio, and strengthen my foundation in data science.
